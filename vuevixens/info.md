# Vue Vixens

## Who are we?
Founded in 2018, Vue Vixens is led by CEO Jen Looper, CTO Michele Cynowicz, and Worldwide Community Organizer Diana Rodriguez.

Vue Vixens is a [501(c)(3) tax-exempt charity](https://www.vuevixens.org/about) that aims to promote gender diversity within the Vue.js community. We are specifically focused on promoting 
people who identify as women, helping them learn Vue.js to build web and mobile apps. We partner with technical conferences to 
provide free workshops for attendees and community members either for a full-day or for mini three-hour classes, which we call 'skulks'. 
Our skulks are based on the successful model pioneered by Shmuela Jacobs for the Angular community (ng-girls.org) who was in turn inspired by the Rails Bridge and Django Girls initiatives. The format involves self-driven code labs completed in a workshop format in groups with mentoring by conference-goers and speakers who volunteer to help.

We also engage the community in other ways, including crafting full-day conferences such as Vue Vixens Day Argentina, and we provide 
support to our local chapters which are led by chapter leaders around the world.

We mentor people who identify as women both on social media including our Slack channel, 
via our newsletter, with personal interactions via our chapters, and at conferences. Our goal is to 
boost the number of women-identifying people who attend and speak at technical conferences, 
help mid-career and senior women stay engaged by learning new technologies, and helping 
new developers enter the workforce.

## How to get involved
If you identify as a woman, you are welcome to join in our workshops. If you don't, you are still welcome to participate by 
mentoring during these events. Our chapters are equally women-focused. We also are happy to accept code contributions 
for our online content from everyone interested in our mission. We also have a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/vuevixens) and are pleased to accept non
tax-deductible contributions that help defray chapter expenses.
